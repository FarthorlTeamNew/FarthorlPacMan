TODO:
Merge both projects into a single working one OR Create a single new project and CORRECTLY adding the already created classes

Reported bugs:
When Pacman tries to move towards the screen border, he simple stops instead of just continuing to move in his previous direction

Features to add in the future:
- Enemies (add them now, or in the next part of the course?) - When they come across an intersection, they should randomly choose a direction to go to. Starting poing - Opposite diagonal corner?
- Add more lives for Pacman - 3 or 5?
- Increased difficulty level - Enemies are more likely to follow the direction of Pacman, and are just a bit faster than before (maybe same speed as Pacman?). They also spawn at random places in the beginning of the game.
- Add the Powerups, which allow Pacman to eat the enemies.
- Multiplayer mode - Two players compete to get more points than the other. Limited time - better with no enemies to get in the way?
- Add more level designs
- Add sound effects - the famous Pacman Waka-Waka eating sound - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbR_-kVEYQ0 . Sound speeds up when Pacman eats a Powerup. Seperate sound for eating an enemy, and for dying.
- Some animations maybe? - For example, when Pacman dies, he shrinks into oblivion

Feel free to add more ideas, report any bugs and work on the code to improve it.
